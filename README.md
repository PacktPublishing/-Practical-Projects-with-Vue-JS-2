## About the Video Course
Do you want to get started with Vue.js, and get beyond an average To-Do app? This video course will walk you through three complete practical projects in Vue.js that show the breadth of the framework, and also show how it is used practically via real-world examples. It fills a void not met by reference guides or cookbooks, but adds value to both of those resources. You will not only understand how to use the framework, but also which choices were made, and why. These projects will act as jumping off points for you in your own projects.
